3. MonoTouch.Dialog - I used a bare minimum extract of MonoTouch.Dialog 
licensed under the terms of the MIT X11 license.

4. TweetStation - I referenced a few classes for the biography views from 
Miguel de Icaza's TweetStation project, as well as the built-in web view
controller, licensed under the terms of the 
MIT X11 license.

5. iDevRecipes - I ported the custom tab bar implementation from Peter Boctor's
excellent iDevRecipes site, unfortunately I can't find any explicit license terms
on [the GitHub project page](https://github.com/boctor/idev-recipes)

6. Glyphish - Tab bar and web browser icons are attributed to [Glyphish](http://glyphish.com).
Two background images are part of Glyphish Backgrounds, and are watermarked. You must 
purchase Glyphish Backgrounds to use the unwatermarked versions or provide your own replacements.

7. NYXImagesKit - Some gradient code was cobbled together from sources in this toolkit under
the license below:
