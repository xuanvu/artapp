	/// <summary>
	/// Sections contain individual Element instances that are rendered by MonoTouch.Dialog
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Sections are used to group elements in the screen and they are the
	/// only valid direct child of the RootElement.    Sections can contain
	/// any of the standard elements, including new RootElements.
	/// 
	/// RootElements embedded in a section are used to navigate to a new
	/// deeper level.
	/// 
	/// You can assign a header and a footer either as strings (Header and Footer)
	/// properties, or as UIViews to be shown (HeaderView and FooterView).   Internally
	/// this uses the same storage, so you can only show one or the other.
	/// </remarks>
	
	/// <summary>
	/// Used by root elements to fetch information when they need to
	/// render a summary (Checkbox count or selected radio group).
	/// </summary>
	
	/// <summary>
	/// Captures the information about mutually exclusive elements in a RootElement
	/// </summary>
	
	/// <summary>
	///    RootElements are responsible for showing a full configuration page.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///    At least one RootElement is required to start the MonoTouch.Dialogs
	///    process.   
	/// 
	///    RootElements can also be used inside Sections to trigger
	///    loading a new nested configuration page.   When used in this mode
	///    the caption provided is used while rendered inside a section and
	///    is also used as the Title for the subpage.
	/// 
	///    If a RootElement is initialized with a section/element value then
	///    this value is used to locate a child Element that will provide
	///    a summary of the configuration which is rendered on the right-side
	///    of the display.
	/// 
	///    RootElements are also used to coordinate radio elements.  The
	///    RadioElement members can span multiple Sections (for example to
	///    implement something similar to the ring tone selector and separate
	///    custom ring tones from system ringtones).
	/// 
	///    Sections are added by calling the Add method which supports the
	///    C# 4.0 syntax to initialize a RootElement in one pass.
	/// </remarks>
